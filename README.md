# First Aid Patches
As the Rust update scheduled for May 4th is approaching, numerous plugins are likely to break due to changes in data types.

To help ease the potential headache for server owners, I've proactively patched some of these at-risk plugins, available for free on [uMod](https://umod.org/plugins), for anyone to download and be better prepared.

If the original authors update their plugins, I recommend downloading directly from their sources. These patches serve only as a contingency plan for those plugins that may be slow to receive updates or whose developers are unavailable around the time of the forced wipe.

Be aware that these patches are subject to further change, as we never know what last-minute changes FacePunch may make.

## How to download
Click on the desired plugin and locate the `Raw` button at the top right of the page. Click it to open the plugin code, then right-click with your mouse anywhere on the code and select `Save As`. Once you have the file, upload it to your server. Alternatively, you can use this link to download the entire repository as a zip file https://github.com/VisEntities/FirstAidPatches/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
